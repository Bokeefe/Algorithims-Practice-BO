// Write a guessing game using looping and prompts!

//Have the user come up with a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive), but not enter it into the computer. Have the computer guess numbers in that same range, and ask the user if that is the number (e.g. “Is 40 your number?”). You can use prompt text (propmt("is 40 your number")) to accomplish this. If the number is too high, have the user enter “H”. If the number is too low, have the user enter “L”. If the computer guessed the number, have the user enter “Y”, and start a new game. Can you write an efficient algorithm so that the computer will find your number in the minimum number of guesses?

/*I am going to ask the user to come up with a number in their head.

next, I will generate a random number. 

Next, I will prompt the user to take my random guess and then input if the guess is "too High" or "too Low" "Guessed it correctly"

run in a loop until user enters "Y"

print something congratulatory

*/

alert("Come up with a number from 1-100 in your head");

//var userInput = prompt("Here is my guess: " + " " + "Please enter a 'H' if my guess is too high 'L' if I guessed too low, or 'Y' if I guessed it correctly.");

		var min = 1;
		var max = 100;

		var myGuess =  Math.floor((Math.random() * (max - min) + min)); //a random guess inside the range of numbers
		var notMean = Math.floor(((max - min) + min)/2); //figures the pseudo mean in the middle of the current range of possible numbers



		userAnswer = prompt("Here is my guess------> " + notMean + "<------ Please enter a 'H' if my guess is too high 'L' if I guessed too low, or 'Y' if I guessed it correctly.");
		
		
		while (userAnswer === "L" || "H") { 
			userAnswer = prompt("Ok, here is my next guess ----->"+ myGuess +  "<------- Please enter a 'H' if my guess is too high 'L' if I guessed too low, or 'Y' if I guessed it correctly.");
			if(userAnswer=== "H") {
				max = max - 1;
			} else if(userAnswer === "L") {
				min = min + 1;
			} else {
				alert("please enter either 'H', 'L', ot 'Y'!");
			}
		}
		alert("I guess it!");
	
// 1 Why isn't it kicking the user out of the while loop once they enter "Y"? "Y" should end the loop.

// 2 Why isn't the max and min range being edited as the user gives input? This simple problem is preventing me from trying more compicated ways of editing the range.
